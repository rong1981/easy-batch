# What is Easy Batch?

Easy Batch is a framework that aims to simplify batch processing with Java.
Writing batch applications requires a **lot** of boilerplate code: reading, writing, filtering, parsing and validating data, logging, reporting to name a few..
The idea is to free you from these tedious tasks and let you focus on your application's logic.

# How does it work?

Easy Batch jobs are simple processing pipelines. Records are read in sequence from a data source, processed in pipeline and written in batches to a data sink:

![batch processing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/j-easy/easy-batch/images/batch-processing.png)

The framework provides `Record` and `Batch` APIs to abstract data format and process records in a consistent way regardless of the data source type.

Let's see a quick example. Suppose you have the following `tweets.csv` file:

```
id,user,message
1,foo,hello
2,bar,@foo hi!
```

and you would like to transform these tweets to XML format. Here is how you can do that with Easy Batch:

```java
Job job = new JobBuilder()
         .reader(new FlatFileRecordReader("tweets.csv"))
         .filter(new HeaderRecordFilter())
         .mapper(new DelimitedRecordMapper(Tweet.class, "id", "user", "message"))
         .marshaller(new XmlRecordMarshaller(Tweet.class))
         .writer(new FileRecordWriter("tweets.xml"))
         .batchSize(10)
         .build();

JobExecutor jobExecutor = new JobExecutor();
JobReport report = jobExecutor.execute(job);
jobExecutor.shutdown();
```

This example creates a job that:

* reads records one by one from the input file `tweets.csv`
* filter the header record
* map each record to an instance of the `Tweet` bean
* marshal the tweet to XML format
* and finally write XML records in batches of 10 to the output file `tweets.xml`

At the end of execution, you get a report with statistics and metrics about the job run (Execution time, number of errors, etc).

All the boilerplate code of resources I/O, iterating through the data source, filtering and parsing records, mapping data to the domain object `Tweet`, writing output and reporting
 is handled by Easy Batch. Your code becomes declarative, intuitive, easy to read, understand, test and maintain.
